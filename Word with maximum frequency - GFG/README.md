# Word with maximum frequency
## Easy 
<div class="problem-statement">
                <p></p><p><span style="font-size:18px">You are given a string that is made up of words separated by spaces. Your task is to find the word with highest frequency, i.e. it appears maximum times in the sentence. If multiple words have maximum frequency, then print the word that occurs first in the sentence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input :</strong> S = "the devil in the sky"
<strong>Output :</strong> the 2
<strong>Explanation:
</strong>The frequency of <em>the</em> is 2, so we return "<em>the"</em> and
its frequency "2" i.e., <strong>"the 2" 
</strong></span></pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px">Input : S = "this is not right"
Output : this 1
<strong>Explanation:
</strong>Every word has the frequency of "1", so we return 
"<em>this 1" </em>as <em>this </em>occurs first in the sentence. 


</span></pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function <strong>maximumFrequency()</strong> that takes a string <strong>S</strong>&nbsp;and return the answer as a string. The driver code takes care of the printing.</span></p>

<strong>Expected Auxiliary Space:</strong>&nbsp;O(N).</span></p>
